    <h2>Internal Energy</h2>
    <div class="callout">
    <span role="img" aria-label="*️⃣" class="emoji">*️⃣</span>
        <span class="callout-text">Internal energy is an energy store that is made up of the total kinetic energy associated with the random motion of the particles and the total potential energy between the particles in the system. </span></div>
    <p>The total internal energy stored within a system is composed of two main components: the total kinetic energy associated with the random motion of the particles, and the total potential energy that arises due to the interactions between these particles.</p>

    <p align="center">Internal Energy = Total KE of Particles + Total PE of Particles</p>
    <h3>Kinetic Energy</h3>

    <p>The kinetic energy component of internal energy is derived from the random motion of particles within the system. This motion can be translational, rotational, or vibrational, depending on the type of particles and the phase of the substance (solid, liquid, or gas).</p>

    <p>In gases, for instance, particles move freely and collide with one another, with their kinetic energy directly related to the temperature of the system. The higher the temperature, the greater the average kinetic energy of the particles, leading to an increase in internal energy.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Potential Energy</h3>
    
    <p>The potential energy component arises from the interactions between particles, which are influenced by forces such as electrostatic attraction or repulsion, and intermolecular forces like van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds.</p>
    
    <p>Potential energy generally increases with distance apart between particles that are attracted to each other. This is similar to how gravitational potential energy increases when an object is lifted higher away from the Earth.</p>

            <h3>Extension</h3>
            <p><i>Note that knowledge of potential energies of particles being close to zero in gases and being negative between liquid and solid particles is not required in the O-level syllabus. However, it will make a lot of sense when we start talking about increasing potential energy for melting or boiling.</i></p>

    <h3>Potential Energy can be Negative!</h3>
    <p>In gases, particles are widely spaced, and the potential energy is minimal compared to the kinetic energy.</p>
    
    <p>In liquids, while particles are still closely packed, they have more freedom to move, and the potential energy reflects the balance between attractive and repulsive forces as they slide past each other. Note that potential energies due to attractive forces are negative and those due to repulsive forces are positive. On average, the potential energies of particles in the liquid state are less than those in the gaseous state.</p>
    
    <p>In solids, particles are closely packed and primarily vibrate around fixed positions, with potential energy largely dependent on the interatomic or intermolecular bonds. When these particles are in close proximity, the attractive forces dominate, resulting in a potential energy that is negative and lower than it would be if the particles were far apart (where the potential energy would be closer to zero or positive).</p>
    
    <p>In the following simulation, you can observe the resulting potential energy as a function of the distance between two particles as a resulting of different types of forces (both attractive and repulsive). When particles have sufficient energy, they can overcome the intermolecular forces and leave one another.</p>
