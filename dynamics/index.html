Students should be able to:

<ol type="a">
    <li>identify and distinguish between contact forces (e.g. friction, air resistance, tension and normal force) and non-contact forces (e.g. gravitational, electrostatic and magnetic forces) </li>
    <li>state that mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a body</li>
    <li>state that a gravitational field is a region in which a mass experiences a force due to gravitational attraction</li>
    <li>define gravitational field strength, g, as gravitational force per unit mass placed at that point</li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship weight = mass × gravitational field strength to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>distinguish between mass and weight</li>
    <li>apply Newton's Laws to:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>describe the effect of balanced and unbalanced forces on a body</li>
            <li>describe the ways in which a force may change the motion of a body </li>
            <li>identify action-reaction pairs acting on two interacting bodies<br>
 (stating of Newton's Laws is not required) </li>
        </ol></li>
    <li>identify forces acting on a body and draw free body diagram(s) representing the forces acting on the body (for cases involving forces acting in at most two dimensions)</li>
    <li>solve problems for a static point mass under the action of three forces for two-dimensional cases by a
graphical method </li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship resultant force = mass × acceleration to new situations or to solve related
problems</li>
    <li>show an understanding that mass is the property that resists change in motion of the body (inertia)</li>
    <li>explain the effects of friction on the motion of a body</li>
    <li>describe the motion of bodies with constant mass falling in uniform gravitational field with or without air
resistance, including reference to terminal velocity</li>
