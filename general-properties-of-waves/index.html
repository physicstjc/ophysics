Students should be able to:

<ol type="a">
    <li>describe what is meant by wave motion as illustrated by vibrations in ropes and springs and by waves in a ripple tank (including use of the term wavefront)</li>
    <li>show an understanding that waves transfer energy without transferring matter</li>
    <li>define and use the terms speed, frequency, wavelength, period and amplitude, including graphical representation</li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship speed of wave = frequency Ã— wavelength to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>compare transverse and longitudinal waves and give suitable examples of each</li>
    <li>show an understanding that sound can be produced by vibrating sources and a medium is required for the transmission of sound.</li>
    <li>describe the longitudinal nature of sound waves in terms of the processes of compression and rarefaction</li>
    <li>relate loudness of a sound wave to its amplitude and pitch to its frequency</li>
    <li>describe how the reflection of sound may produce an echo, and how this may be used for measuring distances</li>
    <li>describe and explain how ultrasound is used, e.g. including sonar and medical scanning of soft tissue.</li>
