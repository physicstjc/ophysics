    <h2>Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor</h2>


    <h3>Motor Effect</h3>
    <p>Place a straight wire horizontally between the poles of a strong magnet so that it lies at 90° to the magnetic field. Connect the wire to a DC power supply through a switch. When the current flows, the wire will experience a force and move.</p>

    <p>This demonstrates the motor effect and the force which moves the object is known as the Lorentz force. Reversing the current or magnetic field reverses the direction of the force:</p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>If the <strong>current is reversed</strong>, the force changes direction.</li>
      <li>If the <strong>magnetic field is reversed</strong>, the force also changes direction.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are two mnemonics that help us determine the relative directions of current, magnetic field and the force: the Right-Hand Palm Rule, which was used in the video above, and Fleming's Left-Hand Rule.</p> 

    
    <h3>Right-Hand Palm Rule</h3>
        <img src="right-hand-palm-rule.jpg">
    
    <p>The Right-Hand Palm Rule is a helpful mnemonic used to determine the direction of the force acting on a current when it travels through a magnetic field. Use your right hand with the palm and fingers straightened:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thumb</strong> – Points in the direction of the conventional current flowing from + to - terminals of the battery.</li>
      <li><strong>Fingers</strong> – Point in the direction of the magnetic field (from North to South)</li>
      <li><strong>Palm</strong> – Faces in the direction of the force acting on the positive charge</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule</h3>
    
            <img src="flemings-left-hand-rule.jpg">
    <p>Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule helps determine the direction of the force acting on a current-carrying conductor placed at right angles to a magnetic field. Use your left hand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thumb</strong> – Direction of Force ($F$)</li>
      <li><strong>Index finger</strong> – Magnetic Field ($B$), pointing from the North pole to South pole</li>
      <li><strong>Middle finger</strong> – Current ($I$), conventional current flowing from + to - terminals of the battery</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By aligning any two of these quantities at right angles, you can determine the third.</p>

     <p>Note: as we are dealing with vectors in 3-dimensions, we need to introduce two symbols for when the vectors cannot be represented on a plane surface such as the screen of the device you are using right now, or the piece of paper on which these vectors are drawn. A cross represents a vector with direction into the plane while a circle with a dot represents a vector with direction coming out of the plane.</p>

        <p>Use <strong>Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule</strong>:</p>

        <p>Point your <strong>index finger into the page/screen</strong> and your <strong>middle finger to the right</strong>. Your <strong>thumb will point upwards along the plane of the page/screen</strong>. Therefore, the wire experiences a force upwards.</p>

    <h3>Force on a Beam of Charged Particles</h3>
    <p>When a beam of charged particles, such as electrons or protons, travels through a magnetic field, each individual particle experiences a magnetic force. This force arises due to the motion of the charged particles being perpendicular to the magnetic field, and it acts in a direction that is at right angles to both the velocity of the particle and the direction of the magnetic field.</p>

    <p>This force does not change the speed of the particle, but continuously changes its direction, causing the particle to follow a circular or helical path. The radius of the path depends on the particle’s mass, speed, charge, and the strength of the magnetic field.</p>
    
    <p>Using the simulation below, change the charge of the particle or the strength of the magnitude field and observe how the deflection of the charged particle changes.</p>
