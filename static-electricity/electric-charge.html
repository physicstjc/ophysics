    <h2>Electric Charge</h2>
    
        <h3>Charged Particles</h3>
        All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which contain even smaller particles: protons (positive charge), electrons (negative charge), and neutrons (no charge). Objects can become electrically charged if they gain or lose electrons. There are two types of charge:

        <ul><li>Positive (+): when an object has lost electrons.</li>
        <li>Negative (−): when an object has gained electrons.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Electric charge is measured in coulombs (C). One electron carries a very small charge of about $−1.6 × 10^{-19}$ C.</p>
           
        <h3>Electric Forces</h3>
        <p>Charged objects interact with each other through a force called the electrostatic force. The rules are:</p>

        <ul><li>Like charges repel each other (e.g., + repels +, − repels −)</li>

            <li> Unlike charges attract each other (e.g., + attracts −)</li></ul>

        <p>This is why, for example, a charged balloon can stick to a wall—it’s attracted by opposite charges induced in the wall’s surface.</p>
    
    <h3>Charging by Friction</h3>
    
        <p>When two different materials are rubbed together (like a balloon on hair or a plastic rod on a cloth), electrons are transferred from one material to the other. This process is called charging by friction:</p>

        <ul><li>The material losing electrons becomes positively charged</li>

            <li>The material gaining electrons becomes negatively charged</li></ul>

        <p>This does not involve protons moving—only electrons are transferred during rubbing.</p>
    
        <h3>Charging by Induction</h3>

          <p>
            Charging by <strong>induction</strong> means charging an object <strong>without touching it</strong>. Here’s a common demonstration:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bring a negatively charged rod near (but not touching) a neutral metal can.</li>
            <li>Electrons in the can are repelled and move away from the side nearest to the rod.</li>
            <li>If you now <strong>ground</strong> the can (e.g., by touching the far end), the excess electrons leave.</li>
            <li>Remove the ground and then the rod. The can is left <strong>positively charged</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
