Students should be able to:

<ol type="a">
    <li>state that current is the rate of flow of charge and that it is measured in amperes</li>
    <li>distinguish between conventional current and electron flow</li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship charge = current &times; time to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>state that the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of a source is the work done per unit charge by the source in driving charges around a complete circuit and that it is measured in volts</li>
    <li>calculate the total e.m.f. where several sources are arranged in series</li>
    <li>state that the potential difference (p.d.) across a component in a circuit is the work done per unit charge in driving charges through the component and that it is measured in volts</li>
    <li>state that resistance = p.d. / current</li>
    <li>apply the relationship R = V / I to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship of the proportionality between resistance and the length and crosssectional area of a wire to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>describe the effect of temperature increase on the resistance of a metallic conductor</li>
    <li>sketch and interpret the I-V characteristic graphs for a metallic conductor at constant temperature (ohmic conductor), for a filament lamp and for a semiconductor diode.</li>
