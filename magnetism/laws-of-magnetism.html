    <h2>Laws of Magnetism</h2>
    
        
    <h3>Properties of Magnets</h3>

 
    <p>A magnet is an object that produces a magnetic field and can attract magnetic materials like iron, cobalt, and nickel. These are the properties of a magnet:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two poles:</strong> Every magnet has a north and a south pole located at its ends. There is no isolated magnetic pole.</li>
        <li><strong>Like poles repel:</strong> North–north or south–south poles push away from each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Unlike poles attract:</strong> North–south poles pull toward each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Fields stronger at poles:</strong> The magnetic field is strongest near the poles and weaker farther away.</li>
        <li><strong>Field vector addition:</strong> Magnetic field vectors can add up to obtain a new vector that is equal to the sum of the two or more vectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment with Earth:</strong> If freely suspended, a magnet aligns with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing north–south.</li>
        <li><strong>Attraction of magnetic materials:</strong> Magnets attract ferromagnetic materials (iron, cobalt, nickel, steel), but do not affect non‑magnetic materials like plastic or wood.</li>
      </ul>

    <p><em>Note:</em> Only magnets can repel one another—this is the only sure way to identify a magnet!</p>

    <h3>Induced Magnetism</h3>

    <p>When a magnetic material like soft iron or a steel paperclip is brought near a strong magnet or placed inside a current-carrying solenoid, it becomes temporarily magnetized through induced magnetism.</p>
    
    <p><em>Near a Permanent Magnet:</em> As you bring an unmagnetized piece of iron close to the north pole of a permanent magnet, the magnetic field exerts forces on the iron’s internal domains, aligning them. The end closest to the magnet becomes a temporary south pole, while the far end becomes a north pole. Because unlike poles attract, the induced south pole is drawn toward the magnet’s north pole, causing attraction.</p>
    
    <p><em>Near a Current-Carrying Solenoid:</em> When a magnetic material is placed near a solenoid with electric current, the coil’s magnetic field aligns the domains in the material, effectively turning it into a magnet with its own north and south poles. This induced magnetism strengthens the overall magnetic field of the solenoid.</p>
