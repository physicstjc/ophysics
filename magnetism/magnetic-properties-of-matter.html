    <h2>Magnetic Properties of Matter</h2>
    
        <h3>Induced Magnetism</h3>

        <p>When a magnetic material like soft iron or a steel paperclip is brought near a strong magnet or placed inside a current-carrying solenoid, it becomes temporarily magnetized through induced magnetism.</p>

        <p><em>Near a Permanent Magnet:</em> As you bring an unmagnetized piece of iron close to the north pole of a permanent magnet, the magnetic field exerts forces on the iron’s internal domains, aligning them. The end closest to the magnet becomes a temporary south pole, while the far end becomes a north pole. Because unlike poles attract, the induced south pole is drawn toward the magnet’s north pole, causing attraction.</p>

        <p><em>Near a Current-Carrying Solenoid:</em> When a magnetic material is placed near a solenoid with electric current, the coil’s magnetic field aligns the domains in the material, effectively turning it into a magnet with its own north and south poles. This induced magnetism strengthens the overall magnetic field of the solenoid.</p>

        <h3>Temporary vs Permanent Magnets</h3>
        
             <p>Magnets can be broadly classified into <strong>temporary magnets</strong> and <strong>permanent magnets</strong>. Both produce magnetic fields, but they differ in how they retain their magnetism and how they are used in practical applications.</p>
