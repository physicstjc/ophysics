Students should be able to:

<ol type="a">
<li>show an understanding that physical quantities typically consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit</li>
<li>recall the following base quantities and their units: mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A), temperature
(K), amount of substance (mol)</li>
<li>use the following prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal sub-multiples and multiples of the SI units:
nano (n), micro (μ), milli (m), centi (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), tera (T)</li>
<li>show an understanding of the orders of magnitude of the sizes of common objects ranging from a typical
atom to the Earth</li>
<li>select and explain the use of appropriate measuring instruments to measure or determine physical
quantities listed in ‘Summary of key quantities, symbols and units’ taking into consideration the range and
precision of the instrument</li>
<li>state what is meant by scalar and vector quantities and give common examples of each</li>
<li>add two vectors to determine a resultant by a graphical method</li>
