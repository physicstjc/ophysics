        <h2>Energy Stores and Transfers</h2>
   
        <h3>Energy Stores</h3>
        
        <p>In our daily lives, we come across and require different kinds of energy for efficient living. Energy can be described as being in different ‘stores’. Each energy store can be associated with a system in which its elements possess the energy store or interact through the transfer of energy between energy stores.</p>
        
        <p>The SI unit of Energy is the joule (J). Energy is a scalar quantity.</p>
        
        <p>Examples of energy stores are:</p>
        
        
        <table align="center">
            <tr align="center"><th>Energy Store</th><th>Example of System</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Kinetic store</td><td>Object in motion</td><td><p>Energy that a body has due to its movement.</p>
            $$E_k = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$$
            <p>where 	$E_k$: energy in the kinetic store (in J)
            <br>$m$: mass of the body (in kg)
            <br>$v$: speed of the body (in m s<sup>–1</sup>) 
            </p>
            </td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Gravitational potential store</td><td>Object and the Earth</td><td><p>The energy that a body has due to its position above the reference level.</p>

            $$E_p = mgh$$
            <p>where 	$E_p$: energy in the gravitational potential store (in J)
            <br>$m$: mass of the body (in kg)
            <br>$g$: gravitational field strength (in N kg<sup>–1</sup>)
            <br>$h$: height above reference level (in m) 	
            </p>
            Note:
            Gravitational potential energy is assumed to be 0 J at a reference level that is usually the lowest point (e.g. ground). 
            </td></tr>
            <tr><td>Chemical potential store</td><td>Food, battery</td><td><p>Energy that is stored in substances due to the positions of particles that make up the substance.</p>
            <p>Fuels such as oil, wood, coal, electric cells, food and explosives have chemical potential energy.</p></td></tr>
            
            <tr><td>Elastic potential store</td><td>Mass suspended on a spring</td><td>Energy stored in a spring when it is held in a stretched or compressed state.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Internal store</td><td>Molecules in a body</td><td>The sum of the random microscopic kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms and molecules in a body.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Nuclear store</td><td>Nuclear reactor</td><td>The energy stored in the nucleus of an atom and may be released during nuclear fission or fusion.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Electrostatic store</td><td>Thunderclouds</td><td>The energy stored due to relative movement between electric charges.</td></tr>

        <h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>
        <div class="callout">
        <span role="img" aria-label="*️⃣" class="emoji">*️⃣</span>
        <span class="callout-text">Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be transferred from one store to another.  The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.</span></div>

        
        <p>The principle of the conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another. This means that the total energy in an isolated system remains constant over time. To apply this principle to new situations or solve related problems, identify all forms of energy involved, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, or chemical energy. Calculate the initial and final energies, ensuring they are equal, accounting for energy transfers or transformations.</p>
        <p>The word equation for this calculation can be simplied as:</p>
        <p align="center">Initial energy stores + Energy transferred in = Final energy stores + Energy transferred out</p>
        <p>For example, when a cyclist on a moving bicycle goes down a slope without pedalling, the gravitational potential energy at the highest point converts into kinetic energy as it descends, while the total energy remains constant. By understanding and tracking these energy changes, you can solve a wide range of physics problems accurately.</p>
        
        <h3>Energy Transfer Diagrams</h3>
        <p>These energy transfers can also be represented using bar charts with the use of squares to represent the rough quantity changes before calculation is done. This method helps in visualisation and organising the energy conversions for calculation.</p>

        <figure><img src="energy-transfer-bicycle-slope.png"></figure><figcaption>Energy transfer for a descending bicycle.</figcaption>
        
        <p>On the other hand, if the cyclist applies the brakes as the bicycle descends such that it comes to a stop, the energy at the end is in the internal energy store.</p>
        
        <figure><img src="energy-transfer-bicycle.png"></figure><figcaption>Energy transfer for a descending bicycle as brakes are applied.</figcaption>
        
        <p>The diagram can also be applied to non-isolated systems. When we consider the energy transfer related to a light bulb, we will need to include the energy transferred into and out of the system.</p>
        
        <figure><img src="energy-transfer-circuit-diagram.png"></figure><figcaption>Circuit diagram with a light bulb and battery</figcaption>
        <figure><img src="energy-transfer-bulb.png"></figure><figcaption>Energy transfer for a light bulb.</figcaption>
        
        <p>Depending on the elements considered within a system, the energy transfer can sometimes be internal. For example, in the context of the light bulb, if we consider the circuit as the system of concern, the energy transferred electrically to the bulb can be visualised instead as a direct transfer of chemical potential energy to other forms of energy.</p>
        
        <figure><img src="energy-transfer-circuit.png"></figure><figcaption>Energy transfer for an electric circuit involving a light bulb.</figcaption>
        
        <p>However, regardless of which diagram is used, the energy calculations should still be consistent.</p>

        <h3>Check for Understanding</h3>
        <p>A 5.0 kg object is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Assuming there is no air resistance, calculate the velocity of the object just before it hits the ground using the principle of conservation of energy. Take g = 10 m s⁻²</p>

        <div id="ans2" style="display:none">
            <p>The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy remains constant. Here, the potential energy at the height is converted into kinetic energy just before impact.</p>
            <p>Potential Energy (PE) at height, $PE = mgh = 5.0 \text{ kg} \times 10 \text{ m/s}^2 \times 10 \text{ m} = 500 \text{ J}$</p>
            <p>Kinetic Energy (KE) just before impact, $KE = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 = PE$</p>
            <p>So, $\dfrac{1}{2} \times 5.0 \text{ kg} \times v^2 = 500 \text{ J}$</p>
            <p>$v^2 = \dfrac{500 \text{ J}}{2.5 \text{ kg}} = 200 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2$</p>
            <p>$v = \sqrt{200 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 14 \text{ m/s}$</p>
            <p>Therefore, the velocity of the object just before it hits the ground is 14 m/s.</p>
