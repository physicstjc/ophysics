Students should be able to:

<ol type="a">
    <li>show an understanding that there are energy stores, e.g. kinetic, potential (gravitational, chemical, elastic), nuclear and internal, and that energy can be transferred from one store to another: 
        <ol type="i">
            <li>mechanically (by a force acting over a distance)</li>
            <li>electrically (by an electric current)</li>
            <li>by heating (due to a temperature difference)</li>
            <li>by propagation of waves (both electromagnetic and mechanical) </li>
        </ol></li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationships for kinetic energy (E<sub>k</sub> = ½ mv<sup>2</sup>) and gravitational potential energy near the Earth's surface (E<sub>k</sub> = mgh) to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>state the principle of the conservation of energy and apply the principle to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship work done = force × distance moved in the direction of the force to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>recall and apply the relationship power = energy transfer / time taken to new situations or to solve related problems</li>
    <li>calculate the efficiency of an energy transfer using the formula efficiency = useful energy output / total
        energy input</li>
    <li>discuss the use of non-renewable energy resources such as fossil fuel and nuclear fuel, and renewable energy resources such as biofuel, wind, tides, hydropower, geothermal reservoirs and solar to generate electricity in terms of efficiency of energy transfer, cost, reliability and their environmental impact.</li>
